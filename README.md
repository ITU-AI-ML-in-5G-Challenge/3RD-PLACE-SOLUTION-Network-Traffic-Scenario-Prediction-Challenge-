# Network Trafffic Scenario prediction Challenge by ITU: 
Traffic scenario classification can be used in multiple service scenarios to accurately optimize 
network parameters or take different management and control measures based on the specific 
scenario. For example, in intelligent operation and maintenance, different fault types can be 
identified based on the traffic performance caused by each fault. In intelligent congestion 
control, rate control parameters can be configured based on traffic performance to ensure high 
throughput, low delay, and no packet loss. However, the status parameters of traffic in 
different scenarios may not differ significantly due to limitations in the collection device. 
Moreover, the number of scenarios within a given duration is uncertain, and random switching 
between scenarios can make it difficult to identify them. In some real-time decision situations, 
a response time of milliseconds or even microseconds may be required, which presents a 
greater challenge in solving the problem.

# Objective of the Analysis: 
The primary objective of this traffic scenario classification task is to build a model based on the 
training set data to predict the traffic scenario for unknown traffic at each moment. For 
instance, in this context, an "unknown scenario" refers to a scenario with known traffic but 
unclear which of the known scenarios it belongs to, rather than a completely new scenario that 
has never occurred before.

# Note: 
The thorough explanation about the methodology used, modeeling stragegy or structure or choice of model used, data processing etc. can be found inside the report and the finl notebook (code) attached respectively on this Repo for better understanding.

Thank you ITU for organizing such a great project and also for the chance to be a part of this. 
There is a great take away from this.
